You can choose the standart to use (winapi or std::thread) for threading when building with cmake.
To do it, add an option to cmake utility call. For example:

cmake -DUSE_STD_THREAD=ON ..
^This command will instruct cmake to build with std::thread

cmake -DUSE_WINAPI=ON ..
^This command will instruct cmake to build with winapi

cmake ..
^By default, cmake will build this project with winapi (if on windows, in case you are building on Linux, the default option is std::thread).
