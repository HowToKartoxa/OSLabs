> Install CMake from here https://cmake.org/download/#latest and add it to PATH environment variable (CMake install wizard will suggest you to do it).

> ## 2) Prepare and build
> Now create a new directory in the directory that contains CMakeLists.txt . Open a powershell (or cmd) terminal in the folder you've created and type "cmake ..". If everything went well, [TODO: continue with build]
