First of all you need to install Boost to run the Boost implementation and tests of this lab (at least install Boost.test, Boost.DateTime and Boost.interprocess). 
All instructions to install Boost libraries can be found here: https://www.boost.org/doc/user-guide/getting-started.html
Winapi implementation should build correctly without the need to install Boost.

You can choose the standard to use (winapi or boost::interprocess) for process syncronization when building with cmake.
To do it, add an option to cmake utility call. For example:

cmake -DUSE_BOOST=ON ..
^This command will instruct cmake to build with boost::interprocess

cmake -DUSE_WINAPI=ON ..
^This command will instruct cmake to build with winapi

cmake ..
^By default, cmake will build this project with winapi (if on Windows, on Linux this lab does not compile (because it still uses winapi for creating processes) 😢, sorry).

P.S. the Linux compatible version may appear soon (i'll try to use Boost.process)
